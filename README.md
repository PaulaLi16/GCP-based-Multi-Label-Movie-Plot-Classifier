# GCP-based-Multi-Label-Movie-Plot-Classifier

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and data for a Big Data Machine Learning project aimed at solving the multi-label movie plot classification problem. The project leverages PySpark to build a robust NLP pipeline and classification models for predicting multiple movie tags. It is executed using a big data cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) DataProc

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the dataset file mpst_full_data.csv, which can be downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cryptexcode/mpst-movie-plot-synopses-with-tags) and placed here.

notebooks: The Jupyter Notebook movie_plot_multi_label_classifier.ipynb in this directory serves as the primary code file for the project. You'll also find the notebook available HTML formats (movie_plot_multi_label_classifier.html).

README.md: The project's README file provides an overview of the project and other relevant information.
